🎓 Actuarial Science student at UNAM | 📊 Data Science & Machine Learning  
  Turning data into insights, automation, and intelligent decision-making

  ## About Me ⭐  

I´m a final-year Actuarial Science student at UNAM with a strong focus on Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI-driven analytics, my background combines solid mathematical and statistical foundations with hands-on experience in data analysis, automation, and scalable reporting systems.

I have experience working with large datasets, designing end-to-end ETL pipelines, and building analytical models to support financial and business decision-making, I enjoy transforming raw, messy data into clear insights through statistical modeling, visualization and machine learning techniques.

Currently, I work as a Financial Planning Intern, where I automate reporting processes, develop analytical pipelines, and design data-driven models that directly impact sales performance and contribution margin analysis, I am particularly interested in applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to real-world problems in analytics, finance, and intelligent systems.
